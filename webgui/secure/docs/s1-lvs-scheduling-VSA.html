			One of the advantages of using LVS is its ability to perform flexible, IP-level load balancing on the real server pool. This flexibility is due to the variety of scheduling algorithms an administrator can choose from when configuring LVS. LVS load balancing is superior to less flexible methods, such as <em class="firstterm">Round-Robin DNS</em> where the hierarchical nature of DNS and the caching by client machines can lead to load imbalances. Additionally, the low-level filtering employed by the LVS router has advantages over application-level request forwarding because balancing loads at the network packet level causes minimal computational overhead and allows for greater scalability.
		</p>
      <p>
			Using scheduling, the active router can take into account the real servers' activity and, optionally, an administrator-assigned <em class="firstterm">weight</em> factor when routing service requests. Using assigned weights gives arbitrary priorities to individual machines. Using this form of scheduling, it is possible to create a group of real servers using a variety of hardware and software combinations and the active router can evenly load each real server.
		</p>
      <p>
			The scheduling mechanism for LVS is provided by a collection of kernel patches called <em class="firstterm">IP Virtual Server</em> or <em class="firstterm">IPVS</em> modules. These modules enable <em class="firstterm">layer 4</em> (<em class="firstterm">L4</em>) transport layer switching, which is designed to work well with multiple servers on a single IP address.
		</p>
      <p>
			To track and route packets to the real servers efficiently, IPVS builds an <em class="firstterm">IPVS table</em> in the kernel. This table is used by the active LVS router to redirect requests from a virtual server address to and returning from real servers in the pool. The IPVS table is constantly updated by a utility called <em class="firstterm">ipvsadm</em> — adding and removing cluster members depending on their availability.

- pulled in Wensong's memory leak patchs
- Dropped the shared scsi portion in the web interface
  Note: FOS will vanish in piranha 0.7.0's interface, in
  theory that functionality will be taken over by clumanager
  which is part of the advanced server offering.
  In the future clumanager/piranha will merge (so I'm told)

* Fri Jan 18 2002 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>

  sock=socket(AF_INET,SOCK_RAW,htons(ETH_P_RARP));
  back to
  sock=socket(AF_INET,SOCK_PACKET,htons(ETH_P_RARP));
  as I got reports that this wasn't working.
  It will work fine, just there will be noise that it's
  an obsolete interface

* Thu Jan 17 2002 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Finally someone spotted the reason why the children don't die
  much happiness spread by Sebastien <sebastien.bonnet@experian.fr>

* Thu Dec 13 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Added in a patch I got from pzb for to be a good deal more sensible
  about how we detect if we're using FOS mode or LVS mode other than looking
  for a start or stop script (shudder)

- Merged in Wensongs quiesce server patch for nanny
- Updated the web interface to also know about the quiesce option

* Wed Nov 21 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Merged in a patch for nanny.c from Wensong <wensong@gnuchina.org>
  which cleans up the run() function by splitting out two new
  funcions, adjustWeight(), and checkState().
- I thought I'd removed the portion in the Makefile that tweaks with
  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf but it was still there when I looked.
  Removed it.

* Thu Nov 20 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- control.php3 has for ages been calling /usr/sbin/ipvsadm.
  Unfortunately that changed to /sbin and was not updated
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56497
- In the pulse.c code, too few elements were allocated
  for the arguments causeing an occasional segv. 
  
* Thu Oct 11 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Forgot to bump the release number for the build system

  to prevent the fos call to nanny checking the real IP
  instead of the VIP

- Fix segfault when not using multipath heartbeat (bug #54506).

* Mon Oct 8 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Bundled in some very simple template scripts with the
  documentation. Dropped in an example_script with the
  main dist. Bumped the version number (0.6.0-10)

* Mon Oct 2 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Minor changelog entries and bumped version number

* Sun Sep 30 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Removed nasty httpd.conf modifications in the
  rpm spec file. (An artifact of the old install
  system)

  send_program function. Probably need to spend a
  week cooking up a library of 'common' scripts
  for use.

* Fri Sep 28 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- dropped in the changes required for usage of
  send_program in the FOS enviroment. (untested)

* Fri Sep 28 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>

  twice in the lvs.cf configuration file

- spec file keeps missing off the modules -> /usr/lib/apache link
  added explicit rule in %%files

* Mon Jul 30 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Humm, killed off the piranha.desktop file as the GUI is web based not X11
  and this makes no sense to try and start from a menu item. A bookmark maybe.

* Tue Jul 24 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Directives from der Boss, we must be able to run rpm -V successfully
- Collapsed piranha piranha-gui piranha-docs into a single rpm  

* Thu Jun 14 2001 Philip Copeland <bryce@redhat.com>
- Made fast changes to the hard coded /usr/sbin/ipvsadm
  to be /sbin/ipvsadm. This should be in a define in a header file
  however because of time pressure I'm doing it this way first and
  fix it up next week.

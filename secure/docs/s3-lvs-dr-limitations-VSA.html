					While there are many advantages to using direct routing in LVS, there are limitations as well. The most common issue with LVS via direct routing is with <em class="firstterm">Address Resolution Protocol</em> (<acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym>).
				</p>
      <p>
					In typical situations, a client on the Internet sends a request to an IP address. Network routers typically send requests to their destination by relating IP addresses to a machine's MAC address with ARP. ARP requests are broadcast to all connected machines on a network, and the machine with the correct IP/MAC address combination receives the packet. The IP/MAC associations are stored in an ARP cache, which is cleared periodically (usually every 15 minutes) and refilled with IP/MAC associations.
				</p>
      <p>
					The issue with ARP requests in a direct routing LVS setup is that because a client request to an IP address must be associated with a MAC address for the request to be handled, the virtual IP address of the LVS system must also be associated to a MAC as well. However, since both the LVS router and the real servers all have the same VIP, the ARP request will be broadcast ed to all the machines associated with the VIP. This can cause several problems, such as the VIP being associated directly to one of the real servers and processing requests directly, bypassing the LVS router completely and defeating the purpose of the LVS setup.
				</p>
      <p>
					To solve this issue, ensure that the incoming requests are always sent to the LVS router rather than one of the real servers. This can be done by using either the <code class="command">arptables_jf</code> or the <code class="command">iptables</code> packet filtering tool for the following reasons:
				</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
							The <code class="command">arptables_jf</code> prevents ARP from associating VIPs with real servers.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
							The <code class="command">iptables</code> method completely sidesteps the ARP problem by not configuring VIPs on real servers in the first place.
						</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
					For more information on using <code class="command">arptables</code> or <code class="command">iptables</code> in a direct routing LVS environment, refer to <a href="s2-lvs-direct-arptables-VSA.html" title="3.2.1. Direct Routing and arptables_jf">Section 3.2.1, “Direct Routing and <code class="command">arptables_jf</code>”</a> or <a href="s2-lvs-direct-iptables-VSA.html" title="3.2.2. Direct Routing and iptables">Section 3.2.2, “Direct Routing and <code class="command">iptables</code>”</a>.

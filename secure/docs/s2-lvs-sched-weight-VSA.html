				The administrator of LVS can assign a <em class="firstterm">weight</em> to each node in the real server pool. This weight is an integer value which is factored into any <span class="emphasis"><em>weight-aware</em></span> scheduling algorithms (such as weighted least-connections) and helps the LVS router more evenly load hardware with different capabilities.
			</p>
      <p>
				Weights work as a ratio relative to one another. For instance, if one real server has a weight of 1 and the other server has a weight of 5, then the server with a weight of 5 gets 5 connections for every 1 connection the other server gets. The default value for a real server weight is 1.
			</p>
      <p>
				Although adding weight to varying hardware configurations in a real server pool can help load-balance the cluster more efficiently, it can cause temporary imbalances when a real server is introduced to the real server pool and the virtual server is scheduled using weighted least-connections. For example, suppose there are three servers in the real server pool. Servers A and B are weighted at 1 and the third, server C, is weighted at 2. If server C goes down for any reason, servers A and B evenly distributes the abandoned load. However, once server C comes back online, the LVS router sees it has zero connections and floods the server with all incoming requests until it is on par with servers A and B.
			</p>
      <p>
				To prevent this phenomenon, administrators can make the virtual server a <em class="firstterm">quiesce</em> server — anytime a new real server node comes online, the least-connections table is reset to zero and the LVS router routes requests as if all the real servers were newly added to the cluster.
